Symmnet-Server
=======

## What is this?

This is an expandable server framework, designed to have large scale use, with tens of thousands of concurrent players, without completely killing the server.
The purpose of this was to get quickly develop a mmo, without doing much work. But developing the engine took a LOT of effort. I was working on this before joining the military, im posting it here, temporarily.
